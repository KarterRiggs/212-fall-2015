Need to do self study on c++ 
-pointers

What is the output? 42 each line.
int o = 052; octal
int x = 0x2a; hexidecimal
int X = 0X2A; hexidecimal
int b = 0b101010 binary

0x regardless of x or X is treated as a hexidecimal number
anything that starts with a 0 is a octal 

Every byte has a memory address

Pointers you just add a * to a different variable type so it kind of just midifies the veriable type
